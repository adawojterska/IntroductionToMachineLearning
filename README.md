# "Will it rain tomorrow?"
This project was created as part of the 'Introduction to Machine Learning' course during the fourth semester of our studies at Warsaw University of Technology. Our goal was to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether it will rain the next day, using current weather conditions as the basis for the prediction.

## Overwiev
To implement our model, we used the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
The target variable, RainTomorrow, is classified as 'Yes' if rainfall for the day was 1mm or more. The dataset includes weather observations spanning about 10 years, with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and current-day rainfall.

The project involves the following steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing patterns, relationships and distributions in the data.
- Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, creating new features and standardizing the data.
- Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to classify rainfall predictions.
- Model Evaluation & Tuning: Evaluating and fine-tuning the models to maximize performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
